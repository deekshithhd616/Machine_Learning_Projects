1. **Project Title**

Loan Approval Prediction Using Machine Learning

2. **Objective**

Objective: Developed a machine learning model to predict the approval status of loan applications based on applicant data.

3. **Description**

Description:

**Dataset**: Worked with a dataset containing applicant information such as credit history, income, loan amount, marital status, education, and employment details.
**Tools & Technologies**: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Jupyter Notebook, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
**Machine Learning Algorithms**: Implemented various algorithms including Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Gradient Boosting.

4. **Responsibilities & Contributions**

Key Responsibilities & Contributions:

**Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and preprocessed the data by handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features.
**Feature Engineering**: Created new features to enhance model performance and performed feature selection to reduce dimensionality.
**Model Development**: Trained and evaluated multiple machine learning models to find the best-performing one based on metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
**Model Evaluation**: Used cross-validation and hyperparameter tuning (e.g., GridSearchCV) to optimize model performance.
**Visualization**: Visualized data distribution, feature importance, and model performance metrics using Matplotlib and Seaborn.
**Deployment**:  Deployed the final model using Flask or a similar framework to create a web application for real-time loan approval prediction.
